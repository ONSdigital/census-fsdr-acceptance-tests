Feature: Movers

  Scenario Outline: A record receives an new Role Id and is correctly moved.
    Given An employee exists in "<source>" with an id of "123456789"
    And an assignment status of "ASSIGNED"
    And a closing report status of "ACTIVE"
    And a role id of "<role_id>"
    And the managers of "<role_id>" exist before moving to "<new_role_id>"
    And we ingest them
    And the employee "123456789" is sent to all downstream services
    And a device exists in XMA with "<role_id>", "0123456789" and "Allocated"
    And we retrieve the devices from xma
    And we run create actions
#    And the employee is sent to LWS
    And the previous "<new_role_id>" gets cancelled
    And we ingest the cancel
    And the managers of "<role_id>" exist before moving from "<new_role_id>"
    And we ingest managers
    And their old job role gets cancelled
    And we receive a new active job role from adecco for employee "123456789" with new role_id "<new_role_id>"
    And we ingest them
    When the employee "123456789" is sent to all downstream services
    Then the employee is correctly moved in gsuite with roleId "<new_role_id>" to "<new_org_unit>"
    And the employee "123456789" is no longer in the following groups "<old_groups>"
    And the employee "123456789" is now in the current groups "<new_groups>"
    Then the employee is correctly moved in ServiceNow with "<new_role_id>"
    Then the employee from "<source>" with old roleId "<role_id>" and new roleId "<new_role_id>" is correctly moved in XMA with group "<new_group>"
#    Then the employee "is" in the LWS CSV as mover with "<new_role_id>"
    Then the employee "<inLogisitcs>" in the Logisitics CSV with "<new_role_id>"
    And Check the employee "123456789" is sent to RCA
