Feature: Movers

  Scenario Outline: A record receives an new Role Id and is correctly moved.
    Given An employee exists in "<source>" with an id of "<id>"
    And an assignment status of "ASSIGNED"
    And a closing report status of "ACTIVE"
    And a role id of "<role_id>"
    And the managers of "<role_id>" exist
    And the managers of "<new_role_id>" exist
    And we ingest managers
    And we ingest them
    And the employee "<id>" is sent to all downstream services
    And we ingest a device from pubsub for "<id>" with phone number "07234567890"
    And we run create actions
    And their old job role gets cancelled
    And we receive a new active job role from adecco for employee "<id>" with new role_id "<new_role_id>"
    And we ingest them
    When the employee "<id>" is sent to all downstream services
    Then the employee is correctly moved in gsuite with roleId "<new_role_id>" to "<new_org_unit>"
    And the employee "<id>" is no longer in the following groups "<old_groups>"
    And the employee "<id>" is now in the current groups "<new_groups>"
  #  Then the employee "<id>" is sent to LWS as a mover with roleId "<new_role_id>"
    Then the employee "<id>" is correctly moved in ServiceNow with "<new_role_id>"
    Then the employee from "<source>" with old roleId "<role_id>" and new roleId "<new_role_id>" is correctly moved in XMA with group "<new_group>"
    Then the employee "<inLogisitcs>" in the Logisitics CSV with "<new_role_id>"
    And Check the employee "<id>" is sent to RCA
