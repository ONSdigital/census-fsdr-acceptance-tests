  Scenario Outline: A record is created in the downstream systems
    Given An employee exists in "<source>" with an id of "<id>"
    And an assignment status of "ASSIGNED"
    And a closing report status of "ACTIVE"
    And a role id of "<role_id>"
    And a closing report id of "<cr_id>"
    And a contract start date of "2020-01-01"
    And we ingest them
    Then the employee "<id>" with closing report id "<cr_id>" is correctly created in gsuite with roleId "<role_id>"
    And the employee "<id>" with closing report id "<cr_id>" from "<source>" with roleId "<role_id>" is correctly created in XMA with group "<group>"
    And the employee "<id>" with closing report id "<cr_id>" is correctly created in ServiceNow with "<role_id>"
    And the employee "<inLogisitcs>" in the Logisitics CSV with "<role_id>" as a create
    Then the employee "<id>" with closing report id "<cr_id>" is sent to Adecco
      ### LWS Requires a device to be created ###
    And we ingest a device from pubsub for "<id>" with closing report id "<cr_id>" with phone number "+447234567890" and IMEI number "990000888888888"
    And we ingest them
    And the employee "<id>" with closing report id "<cr_id>" with roleId "<role_id>" "phone" device allocation details are sent to xma with ID "+447234567890"
