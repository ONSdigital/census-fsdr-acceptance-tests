Feature: Creates

  Scenario Outline: A record is created in the downstream systems
    Given An employee exists in "<source>" with an id of "<id>"
    And an assignment status of "ASSIGNED"
    And a closing report status of "ACTIVE"
    And a role id of "<role_id>"
    And a contract start date of "2020-01-01"
    And the managers of "<role_id>" exist
    And we ingest managers
    And we ingest them
    When the employee "<id>" is sent to all downstream services
    Then the employee "<id>" is correctly created in gsuite with roleId "<role_id>" and orgUnit "<org_unit>"
    And the employee "<id>" is now in the current groups "<new_groups>"
    And the employee from "<source>" with roleId "<role_id>" is correctly created in XMA with group "<group>"
    And the employee "<inLogisitcs>" in the Logisitics CSV with "<role_id>" as a create
    And the employee "<id>" is correctly created in ServiceNow with "<role_id>"
    And Check the employee "<id>" is sent to RCA
      ### LWS Requires a device to be created ###
    And we ingest a device from pubsub for "<id>" with phone number "07234567890"
    And we ingest them
    And the employee "<id>" is sent to LWS as an create with name "Fransico" and phone number "07234567890" and "<role_id>"
