Feature: Updates

  Scenario Outline: A record in FSDR receives an update
    Given An employee exists in "<source>" with an id of "<id>"
    And an assignment status of "<assignment_status>"
    And a closing report status of "<cr_status>"
    And a role id of "<role_id>"
    And we ingest them
    And the employee is sent to all downstream services
    And we receive an update from adecco for employee "<id>" with new first name "<new_name>"
    And we ingest them
    When the employee is sent to all downstream services
    Then the employee is correctly updated in gsuite with name "<new_name>"
    Then the employee is correctly updated in ServiceNow with "<role_id>" and name "<new_name>" and number ""
    Then the employee from "<source>" with roleId "<role_id>" is correctly updated in XMA with name "<new_name>" and group "<group>"
    Then the employee "<in_lws_no_device>" in the LWS CSV as an update with name "<new_name>" and phone number "<phone_number>" and "<role_id>"
    Then the employee "<inLogisitcs>" in the Logisitics CSV with "<role_id>" and phone number "" as an update with name "<new_name>"
    And Check the employee "<id>" is sent to RCA

  Scenario Outline: A record in FSDR receives a device
    Given An employee exists in "<source>" with an id of "<id>"
    And an assignment status of "<assignment_status>"
    And a closing report status of "<cr_status>"
    And a role id of "<role_id>"
    And we ingest them
    And the employee is sent to all downstream services
    And a device exists in XMA with "<role_id>", "<phone_number>" and "<status>"
    And we retrieve the devices from xma
    And we run create actions
    When the employee is sent to all downstream services
    Then the employee "<id>" is not updated in gsuite
    Then the employee is correctly updated in ServiceNow with "<role_id>" and name "<name>" and number "<phone_number>"
    Then the employee is not updated in XMA
    Then the employee "<in_lws>" in the LWS CSV as an update with name "<name>" and phone number "<phone_number>" and "<role_id>"
