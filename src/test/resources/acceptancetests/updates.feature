Feature: Updates

  Scenario Outline: A record in FSDR with a device receives an update
    Given the managers of "<role_id>" exist
    And we ingest managers
    And An employee exists in "<source>" with an id of "<id>"
    And an assignment status of "ASSIGNED"
    And a closing report status of "ACTIVE"
    And a role id of "<role_id>"
    And we ingest them
    And the employee "<id>" is sent to all downstream services
      ### LWS requires a device to be created ###
    And a device exists in XMA with "<role_id>", "<number>" and "Allocated"
    And we retrieve the devices from xma
    And we ingest them
      ###
    And we receive an update from adecco for employee "<id>" with new first name "<new_name>"
    And we ingest them
    When the employee "<id>" is sent to all downstream services
    Then the employee is correctly updated in gsuite with name "<new_name>"
    Then the employee "<id>" is sent to LWS as an update with name "<new_name>" and phone number "<number>" and "<role_id>"
    Then the employee "<id>" is correctly updated in ServiceNow with "<role_id>" and name "<new_name>" and number "<number>"
    Then the employee from "<source>" with roleId "<role_id>" is correctly updated in XMA with name "<new_name>" and group "<group>"
    Then the employee "<inLogisitcs>" in the Logisitics CSV with "<role_id>" and phone number "<number>" as an update with name "<new_name>"
    And Check the employee "<id>" is sent to RCA

    Examples:
      | id         | role_id          | inLogisitcs | source | new_name | group                                | number     |
